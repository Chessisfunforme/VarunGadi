	Hello. My name is Varun Gadi and I created this website in 5th grade. I created this website to make people passionate about math. I try to provide easy to understand content to make people more passionate, intrested, and fascinated with math. I will also add new content once in a while.

	I was first intrested in computer science when I met <a href="codehs.com" target="_blank" >codehs.com</a>. I learned <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank" >HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank" >CSS</a> and it was inspiring. It introduced me to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank" >Javascript</a>, and it inspired me to start making this website. I learned about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/asp/default.asp" target="_blank" >ASP</a> and how easy I could make a website with it. In fact, I do not even have to change any code anymore because I used a database and Access using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp" target="_blank">SQL</a> database language to make it easy. In the future, I plan on making one for chess too.

	There were also some challenges. First, the code only displayed on the screen instead of producing the result, so I had to find the correct setting for my computer. Even after that, there were many bugs in the code. I also had to design a logo for my website. But after all these challenges were overcome, the result was great!

	I had to make many important choices while making the design, content, and website overall. First, I did not want a background because it could distract people from the focus of the website. Second, in the logo, I had to find a good statement to catch people's attention. I also put a navigation bar so people will be able to access the links from any page. I also decided to leave the right side of the page empty in case I wanted to add anything else.

	I hope you will spread the word about this website. When I get time, I will add more complex concepts so almost anyone will usefully be able to use this website. It took time, and it was difficult, but the end result was great! I hope you like this website! Thank you for reading this essay!
